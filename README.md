# MUC - Mac Upgrade Chaperone

At times, it can be difficult to determine what your options are for upgrading a given Mac.
So, it‚Äôd be great to have someone who knows all the minutia and can guide you on the best path to take... a guide or sherpa. Or a chaperone!

Meet 'Mac Upgrade Chaperone' üñ•Ô∏èü§µ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
This script will guide you to the best (available) macOS upgrade method for a given Mac. 
Broadly, the upgrade methods range from 'best case scenario' (send an MDM command), through 'not so bad' (manual intervention needed e.g. not enough free space), to 'erase and re-install' (nuke & pave via EACS, MDM command, Recovery, depending on options), and the true dead-end scenario: this Mac *cannot* run the specified macOS version (e.g. incompatible). 

### Features: 
* Target a macOS version to check and report on which requirements are not met  
* Determine the best method available, explain why, provide links to relevant Apple documentation
* MUC conclusion is displayed on-screen using AppleScript, plus two log files are written to disk (general log + error log)
	* Alternative: MUC now has a 'silent mode' that doesn't display any notifications on-screen and *only* logs the results (Thanks to @daniel-maclaughlin for the idea!) 
* Jamf Pro extension attribute for reporting the MUC conclusion into Jamf Pro inventory, then create Smart Groups e.g. '‚úÖ Upgrade Ready', '‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Attention' and '‚ùå Can't Upgrade'

You can view a [example of both logs here](https://github.com/stumcd/muc/blob/c445c4cbc7ecf41b4d41f5c3b449d84ef948b5aa/example_output.log)
