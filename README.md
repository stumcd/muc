# MUC - Mac Upgrade Chaperone

It can be a challenge to determine the best way to upgrade a given Mac. 
So, it‚Äôd be great if we had a guide or sherpa for the journey. Or a chaperone!

Meet 'MacUpgradeChaperone' üñ•Ô∏èü§µ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
This script aims to guide you to the 'best' macOS upgrade method, ranging from 'good' (send an MDM command) to 'bad' (nuke & pave via EACS, MDM command, Recovery, depending on options)

Note:
1. Will this script download and install macOS? **No.**
2. Will this script *determine what's possible and let you know?* **Yes.**
3. Is this still a work-in-progress? *Yes!*
