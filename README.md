# Mac Update Chaperone (muc)

It can be a challenge to determine the best way to upgrade a Mac that someone has handed you. 
So, itâ€™d be great if we had a guide or sherpa for the journey. Or a chaperone!

Meet 'MacUpdateChaperone'. This script aims to guide you to the 'best' macOS upgrade method, ranging from 'easy, send an MDM command' to 'nuke & pave'. 

Will this script download and install macOS? *NO*
Will this script determine what's possible and tell you? *YES*
